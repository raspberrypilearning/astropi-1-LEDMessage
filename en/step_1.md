## Introduction

In this project, you will use the LED array on your SenseHAT to output text, using single characters and scrolling characters in different colours!

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
The <span style="color: #0faeb0">SenseHAT</span> is an add-on board designed by Raspberry Pi Limited as an environmental sensor and display. There are currently two Raspberry Pi SenseHATs, within the [Astro Pi](https://astro-pi.org) Flight Units, on the International Space Station. Young people all over the world can run their code in space as part of the AstroPi programme!
