## Display single characters

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
In this step you will connect you SenseHAT to your Raspberry Pi, and show single characters on the SenseHAT LED array in different rotations. 

If you don't have access to a real Sense HAT, you can use the online Trinket emulator:

The Sense HAT is an add-on board for the Raspberry Pi, made especially for the [Astro Pi](http://astro-pi.org/){:target="_blank"} competition. The board allows you to make measurements of temperature, humidity, pressure, and orientation, and to output information using its built-in LED matrix.

The LED matrix on the SenseHAT is made of an 8 by 8 grid of RGB LEDs. Using python, you can control the LEDs to be any colour you like! 

1. Display single characters
2. Change matrix rotation
